Problem Domain:

    I would like a function that checks to make sure all forms of brackets in a string are balanced. If there's one too many or too few of any given bracket it should return `False`. If a bracket of one kind closes before any other bracket should it should return `False`. If all brackets are balanced it should return `True`.

Description:

    multi_bracket_validation() - takes one string as an argument and returns True if the brackets contained therein are balanced and False if they are not balanced or improperly balanced.
